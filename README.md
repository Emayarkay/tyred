Tyred.

A bicycle maintenance reminder app.

Set reminders to check the wear on your bicycle components.

Get reminders based on either time passed, or connect to your Strava profile to get reminders based on the distance your bike has travelled.

Use ready made components built in to Tyred, or create your own.

Search for local bike shops if you need a hand checking a bicycle component, or help replacing worn out ones.

Once youâ€™ve checked or replaced a component, just reset the reminder.

MVP produced at Le Wagon Web Dev Bootcamp.

Built using Rails.
